## Project #1: New e-Commerce site
Chosen SDLC: **Agile**

Justification: I believe an Agile method of development would greatly benefit PerfectApparel's goal of a ecommerce site as Agile methods are common in internet-based products. Agile would also allow them to constantly update the website with no hassle to attract customers and create a good work environment for the team and between groups.
## Project #2: Dental office site
Chosen SDLC: **Incremental**

Justification: Incremental would work mainly due to our good friend wanting to have basic features first and add more things later. They're flexible with time and want to continulessly support the website with updates overtime.
## Project #3: Nuclear Power Plant
Chosen SDLC: **Spiral**

Justification: Because of the long matenice and lifespan this project needs, a Spiral workflow cycle would probably work the best. Spiral would also give the project a higher chance of succeeding since it would tackle the riskiest problems first.
## Project #4: Department of Transportation
Chosen SDLC: **Waterfall**

Justification: I chose Waterfall mainly because this project looks planned with the requirements already being chosen. The team has experience in projects similar to this so a liner approch should support the fixed deadline.
## Project #5: Reducing Traffic
Chosen SDLC: **Spiral**

Justification: This project requires:
- Real-time updates
- Distributed computing and networking
- Constant moderation

Spiral would solve the heavy risk by dealing with it early. Spiral would also help with introducing the team to these new technologies while refining the project with constrant updates making it more reliable.
## Project #6: Educational game
Chosen SDLC: **XP**

Justification: An XP approch would benefit the fast pace of development and the lack of requirements. XP would also help with the small team size and the project feedback.
## Project #7: Global Health
Chosen SDLC: **Agile**

Justification: Agile would make sense because of the lack of known requirements. Agile development also allows quick releases for future grants and lets new hires integrate into the workflow.
