| Project | Choice | Justification |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| #1: New E-commerce Site | RAD | Because the site uses in-house templates and expects you to use the same tools, the RAD model would be the best choice as it thrives on reusable components which can shorten the development process. It is also a new website, meaning it needs iterative testing and feedback in short cycles |
| #2: Dental Office Site | Agile | The site seems to be small and simple without many requirements to start. The agile model would be a good fit, since they specifically want to add (undecided) features in the future, which would fit the characteristics of a sprint |
| #3: Nuclear Power Plant Monitoring | Spiral | This project seems to be very high-risk and requires a long lifespan. The spiral model has an emphasis on risk-management, forcing you to prototype and analyze risks early in the spiral before committing fully to the rest of development. |
| #4: Department of Transportation | V-model | The 100-page specification means that it is a large project with a lot of requirements, but would likely not need many changes in the future aside from maintenance. The V-model would work well since it requires tests for each stage of development and would aim to meet all the requirements. |
| #5: Reducing Traffic | V-model | This project seems to have stable requirements and be pretty large with a need to be reliable, since billboards influence peoples' daily lives. The V-model's testing phases would make sure that there would not be many defects. There may be a model that fits better. |
| #6: Educational Game | Agile | There are preliminary and evolving requirements with an emphasis on speed. The Agile model would be a perfect fit, since creating multiple games could align well with sprints and would fit well with a marketing representative. |
| #7: Global Health Startup | Agile | This project does not seem to have very many preliminary requirements and the further grants for impact implies that there is not a set end goal. With the team also needing new hires, Agile would be the best choice, because it is more intuitive to incorporate the new hires, as well as there being better opportunities for collaboration with stakeholders. |
