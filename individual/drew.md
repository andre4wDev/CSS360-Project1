| Project | My Choice | My Justification |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| #1: New e-Commerce Site (PerfectApparel) | Agile | One of the key principles of agile is customer engagement, "...attract customers to come back to the site." Unclear and evolving requirements, which makes it agile as it is a cyclical process rather than linear.|
| #2: Dental Office Site | Incremental | The project has a flexible timeline and features will be added gradually over time (appointments, reminders, discounts). Starts with basic information and incrementally adding capabilities allows dentist to have a working site quickly while building toward more complex features. Also matches continually adding capabilities.|
| #3: Nuclear Power Plant Monitoring | Waterfall | Pretty critical in cost and danger so... Upfront planning, design, and documentation, mathces waterfall. The long lifespan (10+ years) and safety-critical nature. Requires thorough verification and validation at each phase before proceeding.|
