| Project | My Choice | My Justification |
|---------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| #1: New e-Commerce Site (PerfectApparel) | Agile | One of the key principles of agile is customer engagement, "...attract customers to come back to the site." Unclear and evolving requirements, which makes it agile as it is a cyclical process rather than linear.|
| #2: Dental Office Site | Incremental | The project has a flexible timeline and features will be added gradually over time (appointments, reminders, discounts). Starts with basic information and incrementally adding capabilities allows dentist to have a working site quickly while building toward more complex features. Also matches continually adding capabilities.|
| #3: Nuclear Power Plant Monitoring | Waterfall | Pretty critical in cost and danger so... Upfront planning, design, and documentation, mathces waterfall. The long lifespan (10+ years) and safety-critical nature. Requires thorough verification and validation at each phase before proceeding.|
| #5: Reducing Traffic Management | Spiral | This is a high-risk project involving new technologies (distributed computing, GPS tracking, real-time systems) that the team hasn't fully worked with before. The spiral model's risk assessment cycles will help identify technical challenges early, from the powerpoint "Designed to mitigate risks of the waterfall model". |
| #6: Educational Game | XP (Extreme Programming) | "Tight-knit teams" (7 developers) and rapidly evolving requirements make XP ideal. Customers (teachers/administrators) need quick delivery for testing, and having a team member who engages directly with customers fits XP's on-site customer practice. Frequent releases and continuous feedback in education.  |
| #7: Global Health Startup | Agile | Chose agile becauseRapid value demonstration – Spiral supports early prototyping and iterative cycles. Allowing tangible results to be shown in 2–4 weeks, which helps secure follow-up grant funding. |
