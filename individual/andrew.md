| Project | Choice | Justification |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **#1: New e-Commerce Site (PerfectApparel)** | **Agile**  | The goal is to build a shopping experience that keeps customers coming back, and features like customization will probably change once users try it. Agile fits because it supports quick feedback and lets us adjust requirements in short cycles. |
| **#2: Dental Office Site** | **Incremental**  | They want a basic site first, then wants to add bigger features later like appointments, text reminders, and discounts. Incremental fits because we can deliver a working site early and add features in steps over time. It matches the idea of continually expanding the site without needing every detail up front. |
| **#3: Nuclear Power Plant Monitoring** | **Waterfall**  | This is safety critical software, so we need clear requirements, heavy documentation, and strong verification at every stage. Waterfall fits because it is plan first, build second, and test carefully before moving on. |
| **#4: Department of Transportation Cloud App** | **Waterfall**  | The project has a long and detailed spec, and our company has done similar transportation projects before. Waterfall makes sense here because the requirements are pretty stable and contract based, so having clear phases, milestones, and sign offs works well. |
| **#5: Reducing Traffic Management** | **Spiral**  |  This project is pretty high risk because it combines a lot of moving parts like distributed computing, networking, GPS tracking devices, sensors, cameras, and real time updates. Spiral makes sense since it is built around finding risks early and doing prototypes, so we can test the hardest parts before we fully commit. That way we do not end up realizing a huge technical problem near the end.|
| **#6: Educational Game** | **XP (Extreme Programming)** | We have a small team and the requirements are going to change, and teachers will want to try the games as soon as possible. XP fits because it is all about quick releases, fast feedback, and keeping the code solid with constant testing and improvement. Also, having someone who stays connected with teachers and administrators lines up really well with how XP is supposed to work. |
| **#7: Global Health Startup** |  |  |
