| Project | Choice | Justification |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **#1: New e-Commerce Site (PerfectApparel)** | **Agile**  | The goal is to build a shopping experience that keeps customers coming back, and features like customization will probably change once users try it. Agile fits because it supports quick feedback and lets us adjust requirements in short cycles. |
| **#2: Dental Office Site** | **Incremental**  | They want a basic site first, then wants to add bigger features later like appointments, text reminders, and discounts. Incremental fits because we can deliver a working site early and add features in steps over time. It matches the idea of continually expanding the site without needing every detail up front. |
| **#3: Nuclear Power Plant Monitoring** | **Waterfall**  | This is safety critical software, so we need clear requirements, heavy documentation, and strong verification at every stage. Waterfall fits because it is plan first, build second, and test carefully before moving on. |
| **#4: Department of Transportation Cloud App** | **Waterfall**  | The project has a long and detailed spec, and our company has done similar transportation projects before. Waterfall makes sense here because the requirements are pretty stable and contract based, so having clear phases, milestones, and sign offs works well. |
| **#5: Reducing Traffic Management** |  |  |
| **#6: Educational Game** |  |  |
| **#7: Global Health Startup** |  |  |
