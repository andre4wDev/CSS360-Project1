| #1: New e-Commerce site               | Agile       |                                              A company like PerfectApparel is an internet based fashion company, most likely changing quickly following trends, hence something that can be easily marketable and turned into something tangible for the users. The agile model will be able to keep up with the rapid-changing environment of the fashion industry. |
| #2: Dental office site                | Incremental |                                            The dentist seems ok with basic implementation, while also being open to expansion in the future, so being change-tolerant is necessary. Since, the incremental model allows for users to use the product early and test features as new ones are being implemented, this allows you to obtain feedback on existing features. There is also an undetermined timeline, which will make it simpler for an independent programmer. |
| #3: Nuclear Power Plant               | Spiral      |                                              A waterfall model might work for a system like this, however, being able to develop and revisit the assessed risks in such a high-risk environment makes the spiral model a little more efficient than then waterfall model. |
| #4: Department of Transportation      | Waterfall   |                                             With a heavy specifications document and a set timeline, especially for a system unlikely to change, the waterfall model will most likely work the best. One of the main drawbacks of the waterfall is the extensive documentation process, but since the specifications are already given, waterfall should be the simplest and most efficient option. |
| #5: Reducing Traffic                  | Spiral      |                                         Another higher-risk system like directing traffic, as well as real-time billboard updates and broad system integration; there needs to be a lot of risk assessment and management. V-model might be a good option, however, it's slow documentation and systems maintenance process might hold it back. |
| #6: Educational game                  | Agile       |                                             Since the team that we're working with is so small and the requirements are said to change, it will be important for there to be constant testing done by the teachers. Being able to communicate with the teachers, getting the design and implementation feedback, and then being able to translate that quickly into new updates is makes this model work. |
| #7: Global Health                     | Agile       |                                             For a project that is predicated on the current affairs, it's definitely important to have some headroom for change. Not to mention the very tight-knit team of 3 to start with, it's very important to have a model that accommodates small teams that can communicate frequently and informally with one another. |
