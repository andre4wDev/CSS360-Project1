## #3: Nuclear Power Plant

> Final team decision: **Spiral**

### Final Team SDLC Choice
**Spiral**

### Why the Spiral model is a Good Fit
We chose the Spiral model because the nuclear power plant is an extremely high-risk system that could be extremely dangerous if any errors occur after it is implemented. To handle this, the model focuses on risk analysis for each development cycle and scales along with the other aspects of development.

### Other Models We Considered
1. ** Waterfall **  
   We considered the waterfall model as well. However, the scale of the nuclear power plant is too large and contains too many moving parts, which make waterfall's stiff nature unfit for the project. It is also incapable of handling risks when it happens at different stages of the process, which the Spiral model excels at.
