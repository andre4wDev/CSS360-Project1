## #2: Dental Office Site

> Final team decision: **Agile**

### Final Team SDLC Choice
**Agile**

### Why Agile is a Good Fit
The dental office website is small and simple without many requirements to start. In the future, they would want to implement more features that are planned and  more after that which are unplanned. Agile would be the best choice for this project because of the very clear short term goals that come from evolving requirements and the constant customer feedback, which fit Agile's reactive sprints.

### Other Models We Considered
1. ** Incremental **  
   The incremental model would also be a good choice because of the evolving requirements. Either one of these models would be successful; however, the need for adaptability in this project, specifically the need to "draw more patients to their clinic" in the future implies more customer feedback and higher flexibility.
