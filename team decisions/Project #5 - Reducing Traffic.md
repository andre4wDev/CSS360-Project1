> Final team decision: **V-Model**

### Final Team SDLC Choice
**V-Model**

### Why the V-Model is a Good Fit
Our team decided that the V-Model would the best choice for this project. It has a very clear goal and stable requirements which will likely not receive major updates in the future. The project also has a large impact on the public, making all errors that occur after the product is released, detrimental. The V-Model specifically tests for each stage of development, allowing engineers to catch flaws early and limit risk before completion.

### Key Aspects
- **Embedded systems**  
    Aside from the project's stable requirements and impact on the public, the combination of software and hardware was another key reason. The V-Model is especially good for embedded systems as they can be extremely expensive or time consuming if failure happens at the wrong stage.

### Other Models We Considered
1. **Waterfall**  
   We considered waterfall as another potential model because of the project's stable requirements and the experienced team. However, the testing phase happens too late. There are too many factors in embedded systems like this which would make errors in the late phases too costly.
