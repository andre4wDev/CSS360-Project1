> Final team decision: **Waterfall**

### Final Team SDLC Choice

**Waterfall**

### Why Waterfall is a Good Fit

Agile fits this project because a lot of the “make customers come back” features will change once we see what real users actually like. 
Things like custom colors, custom designs, and outfit matching are hard to get perfect on the first try, so short iterations and feedback cycles are good. 
Agile also helps because the team is mixed with experienced devs, new hires, and interns, so breaking work into smaller sprints keeps things organized and easier to manage.

### Other Models We Considered

1. **RAD (Rapid Application Development)**
   RAD was a good option because the site already uses in-house templates and expects us to reuse the same tools with minor changes. RAD works well with reusable components and quick iterations, which can speed up development and support fast feedback. We did not pick RAD as the final choice because we still have a lot of coordination work with the interpreter team and evolving feature priorities, and Agile gives us a stronger structure for sprint planning, backlog changes, and ongoing stakeholder feedback.

2. **Incremental**
   Incremental also made sense because we could deliver a basic store first, then add customization and outfit matching later. Agile won out because it is more flexible when requirements are unclear, and it pushes continuous customer feedback instead of just adding features in a fixed sequence.

### Key Aspects That Mattered Most

* **Unclear and evolving requirements**
  This is critical because the user experience goals are big, but the exact features that will keep customers coming back will take testing and iteration. Agile supports learning quickly and changing direction without wasting a ton of time.

* **Dependencies on the interpreter team and reused tools**
  This is critical because parts of the work depend on another group updating the Java interpreter and template system. Agile helps us coordinate, adjust scope, and keep progress moving even when dependencies shift.
