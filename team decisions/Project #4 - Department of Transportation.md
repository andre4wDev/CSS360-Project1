> Final team decision: **Waterfall**

### Final Team SDLC Choice

**Waterfall**

### Why Waterfall is a Good Fit

For this project waterfall seemed to be the best fit due to it's linear approach to the system that is being created. 
With the existing documentation for the project, being able to go through development and getting approved each step of the way was a huge bonus.
Especially given the 18 month time constraint, it was important that this solution was streamlined. 
Not to mention the fact that this team already has experience building similar such systems, waterfall makes the most sense here.

### Another Model We Considered

1. **V-Model**
We also considered the V-model since the project didn't require much maintenance and wasn't subject to change. More importantly it was considered due to testing at each step of the development process.

### Key Aspects That Mattered Most

* **Specific, defined, extensive documentation**
This was extremely important to our decision as the waterfall model often falls short in the documentation regard. Since it is given in the contract, it makes the waterfall method worth using.

* **Time Deadline**
The time deadline was a critical factor in our choices since the waterfall method was not subject to much change, it was more important that the method would be done in time. This ties into the other aspect, that since the documentation is given, the process is expedited and was able to more comfortably fit in the time constraint.
