> Final team decision: **Agile**

### Final Team SDLC Choice
**Agile**

### Why Agile is a Good Fit
Agile fits this project because the needs will change once we start working with real users in developing countries. We can build a small MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first, then improve it through short cycles based on feedback. This also helps us show progress often, which matters because future grant funding depends on proving impact. Agile makes it easier to adjust priorities when we learn what actually helps people the most.

### Other Models We Considered
1. **Spiral**  
   Spiral was a solid option because it handles risk well and uses prototypes early. We did not pick it because it can add extra overhead for a small startup team, and we want to keep the process simple and fast while we grow.

2. **Incremental**  
   Incremental also works since it delivers features in steps. Agile won out because it puts more focus on constant customer feedback and adapting the plan each iteration, not just adding features on a preset track.

### Key Aspects That Mattered Most
- **Unclear and changing requirements**  
  This is critical because we will not know the full problem until we see real conditions, real workflows, and real constraints on the ground. Agile helps us learn fast and change course without wasting months of work.

- **Need to show impact quickly for grant funding**  
  This is critical because the ability to win more grants depends on evidence of progress and results. Agile supports frequent demos, small releases, and measurable outcomes that we can point to.
