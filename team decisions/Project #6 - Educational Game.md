> Final team decision: **XP (Extreme Programming)**

### Final Team SDLC Choice
**XP (Extreme Programming)**

### Why XP is a Good Fit
We chose Extreme Programming (XP) for this project because it is designed for projects that are rapidly changing and have unclear requirements. Its short iterations and frequent releases allow teachers and administrators to test the game early and provide continuous feedback. XP works especially well with a small experienced team by promoting close collaboration, pair programming, and shared ownership of the code. Continuous testing and refactoring makes sure the game remains stable while evolving it quickly to meet its needs.

### Key Aspects
- **Feedback**  
    Close collaboration with educators and frequent feedback support XP practices like short iterations and continuous testing. The small, experienced team is ideal for pair programming and rapid adaptation.

- **Small Team**  
    With XP having practices like pair programming and collective code ownership, it would benefit the project team of only 7 experienced developers. These practices improve knowledge sharing and reduce dependency on any single developer. This also allows the team to respond quickly when priorities change.


### Other Models We Considered
1. **Agile**  
Agile was considered because of it iterative development, frequent feedback, and changing requirements. It would allow the team to deliver features quickly and adjust priorities based on input from teachers & administrators. However, Agile focuses more on process management, while XP has stronger engineering practices that better support rapid change and high code quality.
